# Strings in Python

- Created with single or double quotes
- Can create multiline strings with triple quotes

# Key Characteristics
- Immutable: Cannot change a string's chars once created
	- Any operation that seemingly modifies a string actually creates a new string
- Indexable: Individual chars can be accessed via zero-based indexing (e.g., str[0], str[1], str[2], etc.)
	- Negative indexing accesses chars from the end (e.g., str[-1] for the last character)
- Slicing: Can extract substrings via slicing
	- ex: my_string[start:end]

# Common operations and methods
* Refer to demo scripts for demonstration of methods in Python code
* Refer to https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods 
	for official documentation on string methods in Python
- len(): Returns the length of the string
- Concatenation: Can join strings together using the + operator
- Repetition: Can repeat strings using the * operator
- lower(): Changes the characters to lowercase
- upper(): Changes the characters to uppercase
- capitalize(): Changes the characters to lowercase while capitalizing the first character
- strip(): Removes all leading and trailing whitespace if any from the string
- lstrip(): Removes any leading whitespace from the string
- rstrip(): Removes any trailing whitespace from the string
- replace(): Substitutes occurrences of a specified substring with another
- split(): Divides the string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter
- join(): Joins elements of an iterable into a single string
- find(): Returns the lowest index where a substring occurs within the string/slice 
	- Returns -1 if substring not found
- index(): Like find(), but raises a ValueError exception when the substring is not found
