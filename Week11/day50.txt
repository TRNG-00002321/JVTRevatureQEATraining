# No class today so just prepped for interview

# My Thoughts on the Interview
"My interview went swimmingly. 
The interviewer mostly covered fundamental testing concepts and DevOps. 
I was also instructed to write out my basic flow of logic for Selenium and trivial string operations in Java and Python. 
The interview was mostly structured like a conversation in which the interviewer directed the subject 
towards topics that allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of the underlying knowledge. 
The onus was on me to create the link between the concepts that I learned and the scenarios we were discussing. 
Overall, I think I performed well. 
One thing that I need to work on is developing follow-up questions since 
interviewers tend to learn quite a bit about an individual based on the types of questions they ask at the end of an interview. 
Those are my thoughts. 
It has been a pleasure reading through everyone else's messages. 
I am pleased that we can each confidently say that we did a good job!"
