QEA Training - Day 55

# P2 Presentations today!
# After the trainer intro presentation, my group went first as agreed upon. 
# Our presentation went fairly well, seemingly.
# Afterwards, listened to the other groups present.
# Got more Cognizant onboarding emails -> gotta look at those
# My work laptop just got shipped. -> woot woot!

# Project Presentation Feedback
	# Remember to clean code before merging to main
	# E2E testing -> implement POM (page object model) pattern -> makes writing E2E scenario steps easier
	# Be sure to integrate performance testing into the CI/CD pipeline IRL
	# EC2 auto-scaling could've been utilized to better emulate a deployment environment
		-> could've also helped with performance testing w/in the CI/CD pipeline
		-> need to learn to configure this
	# Cognizant workers attending the meeting were happy with our collective work

# Returned usual remote meeting room after presentations
# Trainer thanked everyone again and said his goodbyes.
# 4 of us ended up not being selected for this position -> will be marketed elsewhere

# Everyone said their piece and we ended for today.
# End of the beginning -> a new journey starts anew!
