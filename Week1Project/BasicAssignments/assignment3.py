# Basic Problem
# 3. You need to perform three separate tasks based on the given input:
# String Input and Print: Take a text input as a string and print it as it is.
# Integer Input and Add: Take an integer input n, add 10 to it, and print the result.
# Float Input and Multiply: Take a floating-point number as input, multiply it by 10, and print the result.

var1 = input("Enter text: ")
print(var1)

var2 = int(input("Enter integer: "))
var2 += 10
print(var2)

var3 = float(input("Enter float: "))
var3 *= 10.0
print(var3)
