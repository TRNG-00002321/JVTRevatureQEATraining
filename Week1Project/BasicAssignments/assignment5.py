# Basic Problem
# 5. Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so
# a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a.
# Just write the code to swap values of a and b at the specified place.

a = float(input("Enter a number: "))
b = float(input("Enter another number: "))

temp = a
a = b
b = temp

# print(a)
# print(b)
