Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to log into my account
  So that I can access my personalized dashboard

  # Background runs before EVERY scenario in the feature
    # Useful in common pre-conditions
  Background:
    Given the application is running
    And the test database is already seeded with users

  # Scenario is like a test case with Given/When/Then
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    # Given specifies a Pre-Condition
    Given the user is on the login page

    # When - Describes the action(s) being tested
    When the user enters username "tomsmith"
    And the user enters password "SuperSecretPassword!"
    And the user clicks the login button

    # Then - Describes the expected outcome
    Then the user should be redirected to the secure area
    And the page should display a message containing "You logged in"
